locktones executes in the foreground until all potential error conditions
have been tested. Once it determines that everything is okay, it becomes a
background process.

Locktones must be run as root so that it can gain access to the following
system resources:

    open /dev/tty0

The --insert (or -i) option has no effect, as the Linux kernel does not
maintain a keyboard insert mode.
