locktones executes as a normal command until all potential error
conditions have been tested. Once it determines that everything is okay,
it becomes a TSR (Terminate and Stay Resident).

The long options, i.e. those which start with two minus signs (--word),
are not recognized because DJGPP does not provide an implementation of
"getopt_long".

DJGPP is a 32-bit system which requires DPMI support. If you get a message
like the following, then you need to install a DPMI driver.

    Load error: no DPMI - Get csdpmi*b.zip

If you're using a native DOS system, then either add the directory
"djgpp\dpmi" (from this package) to your command search path, or copy the
file "djgpp\dpmi\cwsdpmi.exe" (from this package) to a directory which is
in your command search path. The files within the "djgpp\dpmi" directory
are an unmodified copy of those within the DJGPP package "csdpmi4b".

If you're using DOSEMU on Linux, then add a line like the following to
"/etc/dosemu.conf" (syntax is for DOSEMU 0.98 or later):

    $_dpmi = (16384) # Number of KiloBytes of DPMI memory.
